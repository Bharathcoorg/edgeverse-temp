# Edgeverse Project: Updated Review and Improvement Tracker

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Edgeverse project, focusing on building a sovereign rollup platform on Polkadot JAM. The key innovation is enabling independent chains (sovereign rollups) that don't require their own validator nodes, instead leveraging Edgeverse's sequencers, verifier nodes, and light clients while utilizing Polkadot JAM for security and settlement. 

The Edgeverse chain itself maintains verifier nodes that participate in consensus and verification for the base layer, but individual rollups don't need their own dedicated validator nodes. This architecture allows for efficient scaling while maintaining security.

This document includes a detailed improvement tracker to monitor progress on implementing Celestia-style data availability for light clients, optimizing verifier nodes for the Edgeverse chain, building a complete sovereign rollup framework, and implementing quantum-resistant cryptography for future-proof security.

## Conclusion

The Edgeverse project has a solid foundation with its current architecture, but significant work is needed to implement a sovereign rollup platform on Polkadot JAM. By following this comprehensive improvement tracker and roadmap, the project can evolve into a powerful platform for sovereign rollups with robust data availability guarantees.

The key innovation of Edgeverse is enabling truly sovereign rollups that leverage the Edgeverse chain's verifier nodes, shared sequencers, and light clients while utilizing Polkadot JAM for security and settlement. This approach eliminates the need for dedicated validator nodes for each rollup, making the system more efficient, scalable, and accessible.

The Edgeverse chain itself maintains verifier nodes that participate in consensus and verification for the base layer, but individual rollups don't need their own dedicated validator nodes. Instead, they benefit from the security provided by the Edgeverse verifier nodes and Polkadot JAM integration.

The implementation of Celestia-style data availability sampling will enable light clients to verify data availability with minimal resources, making the network more accessible and scalable. Combined with optimized verifier nodes, shared sequencer pool, and JAM integration, this creates a powerful platform for the next generation of blockchain applications.

With these enhancements, Edgeverse will be well-positioned to serve as a foundation for sovereign rollups, providing the security, scalability, and interoperability needed for widespread adoption. The architecture leveraging JAM's work package system and ELVES security mechanism represents a significant advancement in blockchain design.

The success of this project will depend on:

1. Optimization of verifier nodes for the Edgeverse chain
2. Successful integration with Polkadot JAM's work package system
3. Implementation of a robust shared sequencer pool with proper security guarantees
4. Development of an efficient data availability layer with sampling and erasure coding
5. Creation of ultra-light clients optimized for resource-constrained environments
